                Yeah, I speak Binary. But these days, I just stick with <span className='highlight'>JavaScript</span> and some other fine languages.
                Why? Cause computers are getting smarter. Lol

                I am very much interested in everything about technology and engineering. I have been able to try my hands on <span className='highlight'>Embedded Systems</span>, <span className='highlight'>Frontend Technologies</span> and <span className='highlight'>Backend Technologies</span>. 
                I am currently learning <span className='highlight'>React JS</span> and <span className='highlight'>C# (and .NET)</span>.

                <p className='about-details-paragraph'>
                Hiya! My name is Sodiq Farhan A. I am a <span className='highlight'>Computer Engineering</span> major and I am very much interested in almost all areas of technology. 
                I enjoy understanding how things work the way they do. Hence, the reason for my course of study. I started out with <span className='highlight'>HTML and CSS</span> in 2020 and was able to 
                build a couple of simple projects. I was able to participate in a couple of online and on-site internships with this knowledge. 
                Fast forward to some time in 2022, I have been able to learn about the backend technology, <span className='highlight'>Node</span>; and how it collaborates with Front end designs 
                to produce a full stack web app.

                I have some experience with hardware too. I have been able to work with the <span className='highlight'>Arduino Microcontroller</span> and also build projects with it. 
                I use <span className='highlight'>EasyEDA</span> to design PCBs and also troubleshoot circuits.

                I am currently harnessing my full stack development potentials. Wish me luck!
